# Final-Project

Introduction:
Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items placed on the game board. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's own body. Developing an AI to play Snake involves using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to train an agent that can navigate the game board, avoid obstacles, and maximize its score. This project aims to explore the use of RL in developing a Snake game-playing AI, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in creating intelligent agents for playing classic arcade games.
